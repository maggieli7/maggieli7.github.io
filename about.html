            <h2 style="color:#ff0000;">Bruce Harrison</h2>
            <p>Bruce Harrison is the owner and instructor of <span style="color:#ff0000; font-size:25px">Blended Martial Arts (BMA)</span>, a gym studio that was established in 2014 and is currently located in NYC.</p>
            <p>Bruce has been a long time practitioner of several martial arts form for 26 years. Some of his fighting styles are muay thai boxing, jiu jitsu, and kali to name a few. He continues to train and complete in grappling tournaments. Most recently, he took 2nd place in the competition held in NJ by the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation.</p>
            <p>When Bruce isn't training, you can find him teaching martial arts and kickboxing to those wanting to learn self-defense or simply to get fit. His style of teaching is comprehensive in that it combines some forms of martial arts rather than one specific form. He organizes his teachings based on a rotating curriculum that is not tied to the belt ranking system. Students in various phases of training learn the same material together before advancing on to the next series of moves. This system of learning promotes team building, discipline, and self-respect.</p>
            <p>Class usually opens with 20 minutes of body stretches, calisthenics, drills (i.e. jump rope, shadow box, heavy bag), and sprints. He then reviews lessons from prior class before moving on to new material. Bruce not only advises, but explains the technique of each move deliberately so that it reinforces the student's learning and helps them to improve their form. The class ends with 20 minutes repetition of sit-ups, push-ups, and cool down.</p>
            <p>Bruce strives to help individuals bring out the best in themselves. His philosophy approach is to help others achieve a strong mindset and body so that they may reach their life's goals.</p>
